# Deep-RL-Tutorials
A list of ipython notebook tutorials on (deep) RL methods, running on OpenAI Gym and built with Keras on tensorflow. Will include detailed explainantions instead of just codes

## target areas
* Deep Q learning with experience replay, target network, double Q learning
* Policy search CEM
* Policy Gradient (REINFORCE)
* Actor Critic: Deep actor-critic (deterministic and stochastic policy) with various baselines)
* Natural Actor critic
